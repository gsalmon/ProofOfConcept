In-Touch Insight Systems - Proof of Concept Overview
======================
The following is a non-technical overview of the Proof of Concept app.

##Overview
This app uses the Laravel framework for PHP to display the contents of an imaginary shopping cart, and the 
Stripe.com API to allow users to pretend to pay for the contents of that cart.


##Future Development
The application would benefit from:
- User authentication
- Ability to add/remove items from the cart
- Ability to browse available products
- Ability to view past transactions

These features are currently in the planning stages, and should be implemented by the time hell freezes over.
